# An Analysis of the Kickstarter Campaigns

## Section 1

The Kickstarter Campaign is a data series that collected a vast range of measurables within an array of categories that helped Louise visually compare outcomes based on campaign launch dates as well as outcomes based on funding goals per project. The visual analysis provided to Louise will then determine a timeline and a number of means needed to get the full benefit in order for her own play to become successful.
