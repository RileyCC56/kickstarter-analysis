# An Analysis of the Kickstarter Campaigns

## Overview:

  The Kickstarter Campaign is a data series that collected a vast range of measurables within an array of categories that helped Louise visually compare outcomes based on campaign launch dates as well as outcomes based on funding goals per project. The visual analysis provided to Louise will then determine a timeline and a number of means needed to get the full benefit in order for her own play to become successful.

## Analysis and Challenges:

## Results:
### Theater Outcomes by Launch Date Conclusions
  One conclusion we can make based on the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date is that the months of May, June, and July tend to be the most popular time that campaigns are launched but does not show vailed reasoning of why Louise should launch her play during these months of the year.  Of the 1,369 campaigns, 33% are launched in this 3-month time gap. The mean of total successful launched plays is 69.1. This 3-month period is well above the average sitting at 111,100, and 87. The mean of failed play campaigns based on launch date is 41.1. Also, during this grouping, the failed plays per campaign based on launch date was also above average sitting at 52,49,50. Now competition could play into factor in determining if these plays were to be successful or not 
  
  Another conclusion we can make based off the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date is that the month of December play campaigns have a close to 50% chance of either running a successful or failed campaign.
